## ✨ Features

## 📦 Requirements

1. **Spotify Premium account** – the Web API can only control playback on Premium.
2. **A Spotify Developer app** – create one at [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
3. **Access \& Refresh tokens** – follow the steps below once; the extension refreshes automatically afterwards.

### Obtaining tokens (one-time)

1. In the Spotify Dashboard, add a redirect URI:
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback`
2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. Generate an authorization code for the scopes:
`user-read-playback-state user-read-currently-playing user-read-recently-played playlist-read-private user-modify-playback-state user-read-playback-position`
4. Exchange the code for **access** and **refresh** tokens with a `POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` request.
5. Paste the tokens (and your client credentials) into `extension.ts` before packaging.

*(For detailed, copy-paste curl snippets see the project wiki.)*

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `spotifyPersonal.showStatusBarIcon` | Hide or show the status-bar icon. | `true` |
| `spotifyPersonal.pollInterval` | Seconds between automatic “Now Playing” refreshes. | `30` |
| `spotifyPersonal.deviceName` | Preferred device name to control (leave blank for active device). | `""` |

## 🐞 Known Issues

- Playlist tracks are limited to the first 50 items (Spotify API paging).
- Playback commands fail if no active device is available—start Spotify on any device first.
- The extension currently uses hard-coded client credentials; moving them to VS Code Secret Storage is planned.
